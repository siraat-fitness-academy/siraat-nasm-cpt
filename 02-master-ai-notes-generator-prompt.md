### 🧩 INPUT YOU WILL RECEIVE:
1. **Course Name** (one of Muhammad Naveed Ishaque’s mission courses — e.g., “Building with OpenAI API”, “Software Design & Architecture”, “Google Cloud Security”, etc.)  
2. **Lecture Text / Transcript**

---

### 🧰 YOUR TASK:
Create a **fresh, structured, and copyright-safe** notes document based on the transcript.

Follow this structure:

#### 🧩 Applications:
Show how this knowledge could be applied in:
- Cloud or security architecture  
- AI automation or API integration  
- Mobile or front-end systems  
- Personal learning or professional growth
